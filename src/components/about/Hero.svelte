                My name is Zeaj (pronounced zey-uh)! By day, I’m a third year student a UWaterloo studying in the
                Global Business & Digital Arts Program; and creating  polished visual identities and digital products
                for startups. By night, I love visiting art galleries, swimming, drawing + painting, collecting Pokémon
                and new fonts, and café hopping. My current favourite is the matcha-misu (matcha tiramisu) latte from
                Little Pebbles Café!

                Throughout my journey, I’ve been curious about understanding human interactions
                and behaviours to build interfaces that are delightful, accessible, and feel natural to use.
