                Client management processes shouldn't be messy, and yet most often they are. When the process gets messed up, 
                it brings the user's whole system down with it and <strong>negatively impact the ROI</strong>. Now, enter Flento. 
                Flento works as a one-stop shop which centralizes fitness businesses client and member experiences; coming in to help users 
                automate the process of <strong>client relationship management</strong> (CRM). As one of the 3 UX designers on the team, I focused 
                on improving the information architecture & user flows on their CRM and <strong>(software as a service)</strong> scheduling SaaS 
                <strong>software experiences</strong> for fitness professionals and their enterprise clients - this was my process.

            In both the fitness and client relationship management space, it's 
            <span id="market-retain">hard to retain members</span>
            in the long term.
        </p>
        <p class="market-body1">
            Nowadays, plenty of fitness apps are available to assist those eager to improve their fitness levels. 
            According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/891111/eservices-fitness-revenue-by-segment-worldwide" target="_blank"
            id="stat-link">
                recent report by Statista</a>, the revenue generated in the Fitness segment has reached an 
            impressive $4,024.9 million in 2021, and it continues to multiply. The Global Fitness Gym Management 
            Software Market, characterized by a rapid and substantial growth in recent years, is also anticipated 
            to experience continued significant expansion from 2023 to 2031, according to the Market Research Intellect. 
            In both fitness building apps and fitness business/client relationship management, <strong>retaining members</strong>
            in the long term can be challenging. Many fitness businesses struggle to maintain client engagement and 
            ultimately <strong>lose clients</strong> due to <i>ineffective communication, lack of personalized support, and difficulty 
            managing business operations <strong>efficiently.</strong></i>
        </p>
        <p class="market-body2">
            Trainers' interactions with clients are heavily influenced by factors such as empathy, motivation, and 
            the desire to help clients achieve their fitness goals. Additionally, factors like self-efficacy and confidence 
            in their ability to effectively manage clients can impact their behavior within the app. Research by fitness 
            industry experts like <i><strong>American Council on Exercise</strong></i> (ACE) highlights the importance 
            of <strong>trust</strong> in <i>client-trainer relationships</i> and <strong>its impact on client retention</strong> 
            and <strong>adherence to fitness programs.</strong> Every client is unique, with 
            <i>different fitness levels, preferences, and challenges.</i> Trainers understand the importance of <strong>client management</strong> 
            in <i>tailoring</i> fitness programs to meet each individual's <strong>specific <i>needs and goals.</i></strong>
