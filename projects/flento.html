                Flento works as a one-stop shop which centralizes fitness businesses client and member experiences; coming in to help users

            In both the fitness and client relationship management space, it's 
            <span id="market-retain">hard to retain members</span>
            in the long term.
        </p>
        <p class="market-body1">
            Nowadays, plenty of fitness apps are available to assist those eager to improve their fitness levels. 
            According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/891111/eservices-fitness-revenue-by-segment-worldwide" target="_blank"
            id="stat-link">
                recent report by Statista</a>, the revenue generated in the Fitness segment has reached an 
            impressive $4,024.9 million in 2021, and it continues to multiply. The Global Fitness Gym Management 
            Software Market, characterized by a rapid and substantial growth in recent years, is also anticipated 
            to experience continued significant expansion from 2023 to 2031, according to the Market Research Intellect. 
            In both fitness building apps and fitness business/client relationship management, <strong>retaining members</strong>
            in the long term can be challenging. Many fitness businesses struggle to maintain client engagement and 
            ultimately <strong>lose clients</strong> due to <i>ineffective communication, lack of personalized support, and difficulty 
            managing business operations <strong>efficiently.</strong></i>
        </p>
        <p class="market-body2">
            Trainers' interactions with clients are heavily influenced by factors such as empathy, motivation, and 
            the desire to help clients achieve their fitness goals. Additionally, factors like self-efficacy and confidence 
            in their ability to effectively manage clients can impact their behavior within the app. Research by fitness 
            industry experts like <i><strong>American Council on Exercise</strong></i> (ACE) highlights the importance 
            of <strong>trust</strong> in <i>client-trainer relationships</i> and <strong>its impact on client retention</strong> 
            and <strong>adherence to fitness programs.</strong> Every client is unique, with 
            <i>different fitness levels, preferences, and challenges.</i> Trainers understand the importance of <strong>client management</strong> 
            in <i>tailoring</i> fitness programs to meet each individual's <strong>specific <i>needs and goals.</i></strong>

        <p class="streamlining-body">
            In both fitness building apps and fitness business/client relationship management, retaining members in the long term can be challenging. 
            Many fitness businesses struggle to maintain client engagement and ultimately lose clients due to ineffective communication, lack of 
            personalized support, and difficulty managing business operations efficiently. While there are some apps available in the market that 
            exist to solve these business problems, Trainerize and Everfit are one of the most successful apps out there. They also closely match 
            Flento's product offerings and stand out in terms of their features and value proposition. In examining their capabilities, strengths, 
            and weaknesses, I aim to gain insights into how Flento can enhance client engagement, retention, and business efficiency from a coach/trainer 
            and client perspective.
        </p>
        <p class="streamlining-body">
            Many fitness members breakup with their local gym or trainer (typically around the five-month relationship mark), for a variety of different users. 
            Managing business communications effectively and supporting clients can quickly become overwhelming without a great, centralized system and may lead 
            to a loss of clients and customer dissatisfcation. According to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (IHRSA), recruiting a new member 
            is five times more expensive than retaining an existing one, so it was important to look at the bigger picture of how Flento can reduce churn rates from 
            both a client-to-trainer (or DTC) and B2B perspective. Just like in any business relationship, client retention is hard work that requires trainers to put 
            in continuous effort to build rapport and better connect to clients.

        <p class="insights-note">
            From communicating on Instagram, Email, WhatsApp, messages, and more; information can easily get <strong>lost</strong> 
            and messages go <strong>unread</strong>. Flento's in-app communication on top of its business and client management features 
            solve these problems, but is it <strong><i>effective</i></strong>?
        </p>
        <p>
            Flento's current layout for their client profile management is very <strong>basic</strong> - designed with two simple card 
            components allowing you to add new clients, view and update existing clients information in a contacts list style, and 
            redirect to schedule a training session with specific client(s). Below are some of the granular strategies that they 
            struggle with in specific:

                <p>
                    Trainers indicate that they strongly seek out efficient processes and organizational methods for client profile management, 
                    quantifiable service quality and customer satisfaction, and accessing client information, communications, and documents. 
                    Lack of centralized systems and efficient management strategies took time and made it difficult to keep clients engaged.

                <p>
                    Clients may feel hesitant when it comes to training, especially if in a remote environment as they believe they won't get 
                    the same results without a coach being there. Trainers need a way to make online coaching approachable, reliable, and enjoyable 
                    in a time-effective manner.

                We found that a client metrics dashboard should be our primary focus, as there are little to no specific features that provide business 
                with quantifiable data and insights to create business strategies that help with customer retention in terms of the CRM system. Building 
                upon the current system will not only allow trainers to contact, add and update their client details, progress updates, and schedule training 
                sessions all in one place, but also allows them to gain access to reliable training metrics that highlights important data and metrics.
